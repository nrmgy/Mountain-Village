              Established as a home rule municipality March 10, 1995, Mountain Village is led by a democratically-elected governing body responsible for adopting policies with the intent to foster a proud community. It is the Governing section of this site where you
              can find all pertinent documents related to running Mountain Village like a well-oiled machine.

              Fortunately Mountain Village is situated in the heart of the San Juan mountains where the scenic allure is unparalleled. And what better way to relish in Mother Nature than to be in the thick of it every chance you get. With an abundance of winter and
              summer recreational opportunities, our mountains provide a gateway for adventure.

              One thing that sets Mountain Village apart – and keeps us at number one on Trip Advisor – is our gondola system. We provide this form of transportation to the public for free. Yes, free. If you prefer to navigate through Mountain Village by car, you have
              a number of places to park within town limits, though we do recommend you retire those car keys most days.
